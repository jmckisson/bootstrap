# Version: 2.0.0    Rework to build on an MSYS2 MINGW64 Github workflow
#          1.5.0    No change
#          1.4.0    No change
#          1.3.0    Don't explicitly install the no longer supported QT 5
#                   Gamepad stuff (since PR #6787 was merged into
#                   development branch) - it may still be installed as part
#                   of a Qt5 installation but we don't use it any more.
#          1.2.0    Tweak luarocks --tree better and report on failure to
#                   complete
#          1.1.0    Updated to not do things that have already been done
#                   and to offer a choice between a base or a full install
#          1.0.0    Original version

# Script to run once in a ${GITHUB_WORKFLOW} directory in a MSYS2 shell to
# install as much as possible to be able to develop 64/32 Bit Windows
# version of Mudlet

# To be used prior to building Mudlet, after that run:
# * build-mudlet-for-window.sh to compile the currently checked out code
# * package-mudlet-for-windows.sh to put everything together in an archive that
#   will be deployed from a github workflow

# Exit codes:
# 0 - Everything is fine. 8-)
# 1 - Failure to change to a directory
# 2 - Unsupported MSYS2/MINGGW shell type
# 5 - Invalid command line argument
# 6 - One or more Luarocks could not be installed
# 7 - One of more packages failed to install
