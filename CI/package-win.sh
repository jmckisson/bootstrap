# Version: 2.0.0    Rework to build on an MSYS2 MINGW64 Github workflow
#          1.5.0    Change BUILD_TYPE to BUILD_CONFIG to avoid clash with
#                   CI/CB system using same variable
#          1.4.0    No change
#          1.3.0    Remove used of the no longer supported/used by us QT5
#                   Gamepad stuff (since PR #6787 was merged into
#                   the development branch)
#          1.2.0    No changes
#          1.1.0    Updated to bail out if there isn't a mudlet.exe file to
#                   work with
#          1.0.0    Original version

# Script to each time to package all the files needed to run Mudlet on
# Windows in a archive file that will be deployed from a github workflow

# To be used AFTER setup-windows-sdk.sh and build-mudlet-for-windows.sh
# have been run.

# Exit codes:
# 0 - Everything is fine. 8-)
# 1 - Failure to change to a directory
# 2 - Unsupported MSYS2/MINGGW shell type
# 3 - Unsupported build type
# 4 - Directory to be used to assemble the package is NOT empty
# 6 - No Mudlet.exe file found to work with
